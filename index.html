    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data you save using this extension is stored locally on your device using <code>chrome.storage.local</code> (for Chrome) or <code>browser.storage.local</code> (for Firefox, when available). This includes any custom autofill entries you create.
      </p>
      
    <p>
      <strong>No Data Transmission:</strong> The extension does not send any
      data to external servers. All operations are performed locally within your
      browser.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Water.css, Google Fonts, and jsDelivr:</strong> The extension uses
      Water.css, Google Fonts, and jsDelivr for styling purposes. While I do not
      collect any personal data, these third-party services may collect
      information such as IP addresses, browser type, operating system, and user
      interactions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Fonts:</strong> The Google Fonts API logs the details of
        the HTTP requests, including the requested URL, IP address, and
        user-agent, to serve the appropriate fonts. This data is used for
        aggregated analysis of font usage. No cookies are set or logged by
        Google Fonts. More details can be found in the
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy"
          target="_blank"
          >Google Fonts Privacy Policy</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>jsDelivr:</strong> jsDelivr logs visitor IP addresses, user
        agent, and referring URLs for performance monitoring, security, and
        aggregated analytics. This information helps improve the service and
        ensure its reliability. More details can be found in the
        <a
          href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy-jsdelivr-net?tid=311291297"

        >.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Local Data:</strong> Your data remains on your device and is not
      shared with anyone outside of this extension. However, be aware that
      malicious extensions, browser exploits, or physical access to your device
      could potentially compromise this data. Always ensure your browser and
      extensions are from trusted sources and keep your device secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Export/Import:</strong> You can export your data for backup
      purposes and import it back when needed. Ensure you store these backups
      securely as they contain your saved data in plain text.
    </p>

    <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Sensitive Data:</strong> Avoid saving sensitive information in the
      extension. Although your data is stored locally, exported files can be
      accessed by anyone with access to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Regular Backups:</strong> Regularly export your data to prevent
      loss in case of browser data corruption or accidental deletion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Liability:</strong> I am not liable for any data loss or
      compromise resulting from user actions, browser vulnerabilities, software
      bugs, or other factors beyond my control. While every effort is made to
      ensure the extension functions correctly, bugs may occur. Users should
      regularly export their data to prevent potential loss. It is your
      responsibility to use the extension securely and keep your data and
      devices protected.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      I may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      communicated through the extension update notes or via a notification
      within the extension itself. Users are encouraged to periodically review
      this privacy policy for the latest information.
